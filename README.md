palomino battery charger

This was a rapid battery charger for police and other emergency radio batteries. These days, up to a point, rapid charging of rechargeable batteries is fairly common. Back then, not so much.

A highlight of the design is that one of the test cases is that it should be able to charge a battery with a shorted cell. These kinds of workers are not always in a position to go get a new battery so I felt like it was a good idea to make the most of what they had. Having said that, since this was a design parameter, it almost goes without saying that a battery with a shorted cell should not overheat or catch fire if one tries to charge it. Evidently on the Dreamliner, this was not a design requirement. I've always thought this was interesting. They kept blaming the problems on the batteries when a good charger design might not have been such a problem.
